- 👋 Hi, I’m @toruki13
- 👀 I’m interested in working as a MERN dev with a focus on backend and a future on DevOps.
- 👀 MERN-Firebase-Mysql is the current stack I manage, as well a typescript and low level testing for now. 
- Next.js, nestjs and rxjs  are some of the frameworks/libraries I am currently learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on helping others start on web dev and on small projects/startups
- 📫 How to reach me, rogerpineda1314@gmail.com
